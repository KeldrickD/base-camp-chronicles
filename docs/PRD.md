Project Name: BaseCamp Chronicals

Overview:
BaseCamp Chronicals is a browser-based 2D RPG blending sci-fi survival with a gritty “trenches” ethos. The game features AI-driven NPCs, who are fully immersed in the game’s lore and can influence in-game events via a generic action API. The experience is enriched by a robust progression system, base-building mechanics, and a play-to-earn model integrated with Base Coinbase’s layer 2 blockchain.

Objectives:

Create an immersive, lore-rich RPG where every NPC is powered by AI, delivering unique dialogue and behavior.
Reward players for meaningful interactions with AI agents, including unique base-building items and resources.
Develop a progression system where player investments in their base are critical—defense and upgrades become central gameplay elements.
Integrate blockchain elements to enable in-game trading, a dedicated currency, and optional NFT perks without making NFTs a necessity.
Launch initially as a browser-based 2D game using modern web development practices.
Key Features:

Dynamic AI NPCs:
NPCs are powered by AI trained on game lore.
Different tiers (main vs. side characters) have varying levels of API access to affect gameplay.
Action API for NPCs:
A generic API allows NPCs to perform actions influencing quests, base defense, and progression.
Progression & Base Building:

Blockchain Integration:
Utilizes Base Coinbase’s layer 2 blockchain.
Implements a game currency (BaseCampCoin) and supports in-game resource trading.
Optional NFT characters and resources enhance gameplay but are not mandatory.
Accessibility & Scalability:
Browser-based 2D interface ensures accessibility.
Modern web dev practices support a scalable and maintainable codebase.
