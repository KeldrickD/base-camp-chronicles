Frontend Guidelines
Architecture:
Use a component-based framework (React or Vue.js).
Organize reusable UI elements into components.
2D Game Rendering:
Integrate Phaser.js (or a similar engine) for rendering 2D graphics.
Keep game logic separate from UI components where possible.
State Management:
Use Redux/Vuex to manage game state consistently across the application.
Blockchain Integration:
Use Web3.js/Ethers.js to interact with the blockchain.
Provide clear UI indicators for blockchain transactions (e.g., in-game wallet status).
Responsive & Accessible Design:
Ensure the game UI scales correctly on different devices and is accessible.
Coding Standards:
Follow ES6+ best practices, maintain clean code, and ensure proper documentation in code comments.
Use a linter (ESLint) and formatter (Prettier) for code consistency.
