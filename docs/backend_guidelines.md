Backend Guidelines
API Design:
Implement RESTful APIs with Express, ensuring endpoints are versioned.
Use a modular architecture (controllers, services, and routes) to isolate business logic.
Real-Time Features:
Integrate Socket.io for real-time notifications and game state updates.
Database Design:
Choose a robust database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to handle game data, user profiles, transactions, and game state.
Design database schemas that can scale with user interactions and blockchain data.
AI Integration:
Build a service layer to handle AI-driven NPC actions.
Allow dynamic API endpoints for NPC behaviors that are configurable by role (main vs. side characters).
Security:
Implement authentication and authorization (JWT).
Validate API inputs to prevent common attacks.
Blockchain & Currency:
Create endpoints for blockchain transactions, NFT verification (if applicable), and currency management.
Ensure secure communication with the blockchain layer.
Testing & Documentation:
Write unit and integration tests to cover critical game functionalities.
Maintain comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.
